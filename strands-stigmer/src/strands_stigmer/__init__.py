"""strands-stigmer: the execution graph of AWS for Strands agents.

Adds Stigmer's verified method contracts, traps, and least-privilege IAM
policies as Strands tools. Query before you write AWS code; generate a
least-privilege policy for a workflow; write back when you hit a trap.

Usage:
    from strands import Agent
    from strands_stigmer import stigmer_query, stigmer_policy, stigmer_authorize, stigmer_verify
    from strands_stigmer.hooks import StigmerAuthHook

    agent = Agent(
        tools=[stigmer_query, stigmer_policy, stigmer_authorize, stigmer_verify],
        hooks=[StigmerAuthHook()],   # authorize AWS tool calls before they execute
